---To know the current location of the files
SELECT name AS FileLogicalName, physical_name AS FileLocation
FROM sys.master_files 
WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'DBAUtil') 

-- Step 1: Set database offline
USE master
GO
ALTER DATABASE DBAUtil SET OFFLINE

--- Step 2: physically move the MDF and LDF to a new destinations

--- Step 3: Apply the new path (assume you moved the file from D to E and your file names are DBAUtil.mdf and DBAUtil_Log.ldf)

USE master
GO

ALTER DATABASE DBAUtil
MODIFY FILE (NAME = DBAUtil, FILENAME = 'E\MSSQL\UserDBData\DBAUtil.mdf')

ALTER DATABASE TestDB 
MODIFY FILE (NAME = DBAUtil_log, FILENAME = 'E:\MSSQL\UserDBLog\DBAUtil_log.ldf')

*/"NAME" = logical name of the file and "FILENAME" = the new path of the file.*/

---Step 4: Bring the database ONLINE

USE master
GO
ALTER DATABASE DBAUtil SET ONLINE

---Step 5: Verify the new destination using the first command

SELECT name AS FileLogicalName, physical_name AS FileLocation
FROM sys.master_files 
WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'DBAUtil')
