---To know the current location of the files
SELECT name AS FileLogicalName, physical_name AS FileLocation
FROM sys.master_files 
WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'DBAUtil') 

-- Step 1: Set database offline
USE master
GO
ALTER DATABASE DBAUtil SET OFFLINE

--- Step 2: physically move the MDF and LDF to a new destinations

--- Step 3: Apply the new path (assume you moved the file from D to E and your file names are DBAUtil.mdf and DBAUtil_Log.ldf)

USE master
GO

ALTER DATABASE DBAUtil
MODIFY FILE (NAME = DBAUtil, FILENAME = 'E\MSSQL\UserDBData\DBAUtil.mdf')

ALTER DATABASE TestDB 
MODIFY FILE (NAME = DBAUtil_log, FILENAME = 'E:\MSSQL\UserDBLog\DBAUtil_log.ldf')

*/"NAME" = logical name of the file and "FILENAME" = the new path of the file.*/

---Step 4: Bring the database ONLINE

USE master
GO
ALTER DATABASE DBAUtil SET ONLINE

---Step 5: Verify the new destination using the first command

SELECT name AS FileLogicalName, physical_name AS FileLocation
FROM sys.master_files 
WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'DBAUtil') 


---Make sure the service account has access to the new drive
(go to service.msc, check the service name and copy it, go to the drive (E) and grant read write permission - do this by going to "property" in the disk and "security", then "add", paste the copied service account name 
- while doing this make sure you selected "object type" including service account and computer, on "from this location" choose the machine (computer) name)
